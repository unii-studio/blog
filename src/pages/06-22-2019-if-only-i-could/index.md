If only I could tell the whole world one thing. It would be this:

That anything is possible. Not in the cliche way. But in a literal sense, this universe is infinite and far bigger than our minds can even comprehend.

We may think we know, we understand, and are capable. But the world has a way of telling us that we can't, that things are simple, and that we should stick to what we know.

To that I ask: What do you know? And are you sure that you are limited to that?

My answer is that no. Such as the universe is infinite, so are we, for the simple fact that we reside in it.

ERGO, anything is possible. Question is, which possibilities will become reality? Will you choose the best in every circumstance you have the choice. What will your next choice be then?

Remember this if it helps. But forget it so that you may be free to explore your own possibilities.
