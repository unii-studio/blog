{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>If only I could tell the whole world one thing. It would be this:</p>\n<p>That anything is possible. Not in the cliche way. But in a literal sense, this universe is infinite and far bigger than our minds can even comprehend.</p>\n<p>We may think we know, we understand, and are capable. But the world has a way of telling us that we can't, that things are simple, and that we should stick to what we know.</p>\n<p>To that I ask: What do you know? And are you sure that you are limited to that?</p>\n<p>My answer is that no. Such as the universe is infinite, so are we, for the simple fact that we reside in it.</p>\n<p>ERGO, anything is possible. Question is, which possibilities will become reality? Will you choose the best in every circumstance you have the choice. What will your next choice be then?</p>\n<p>Remember this if it helps. But forget it so that you may be free to explore your own possibilities.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"May 23, 2019","path":"/if-only-i-could","title":"If Only I Could"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}
